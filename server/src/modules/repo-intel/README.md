# `repo-intel` — the codebase indexer

`repo-intel` reads a cloned repository **once on clone** (and incrementally on
fetch, keyed by file content hash) and turns it into queryable facts: symbols,
the import graph, a PageRank-based file importance score, and a compact **repo
map** (the project skeleton). On a review it is only **read** — the index is
already computed, so adding context to a prompt costs no analysis at request time.

This is **starter infrastructure**: it works from day 1 (the **Indexed** badge),
but you don't write it. Course lessons build features _on top_ of its facade —
Blast Radius (L04), Conventions samples (L02), Onboarding reading-path (L05),
the Phantom-API gate (L06) — by calling `repoIntel.*`, not by re-indexing.

## Pipeline

  CLONE["git clone / fetch"] --> WALK["walk.ts<br/>discover source files"]
  WALK --> AST["ast-grep adapter<br/>symbols + references"]
  AST --> EDGES["import graph<br/>(dependency-cruiser)"]
  EDGES --> RANK["rank.ts<br/>PageRank → file rank"]
  RANK --> MAP["repo-map.ts<br/>compact repo skeleton (cached)"]
  AST --> DB[("Postgres<br/>symbols · references · file_edges · file_rank · repo_map_cache")]
  EDGES --> DB
  RANK --> DB
  MAP --> DB
```

Full vs incremental indexing lives in `pipeline/{full,incremental}.ts`; an
unindexed or partially-indexed repo degrades gracefully (the facade returns empty
results rather than throwing).

## Facade (`repoIntel.*`)

Everything downstream reads through one facade (`service.ts`) so consumers never
touch the pipeline internals:

- `getRepoMap(repoId)` → the cached repo skeleton (fed into the **review prompt**).
- `getFileRank(repoId, files)` → importance percentile per changed file.
- `getCallerSignatures(repoId, files, limit)` → callers of changed symbols.
- `getBlastRadius(repoId, files)` → impacted symbols / callers (used by L04).
- `getUnresolvedReferences(repoId, …)` → phantom-symbol detection (used by L06).
- `getConventionSamples(repoId)` → top-ranked files for convention extraction (L02).
- `collectTourFacts(repoId)` / `classifyPaths(repoId, sha, paths)` → deterministic onboarding-tour
  facts and path checks, read at one commit (L05). No LLM call. Git churn ("hotness") is computed
  here at tour time over the 180 days before the committer date of that commit; it is **not**
  stored — `file_rank.hotness` stays 0 and the stored rank is PageRank only.

In the starter, only `getRepoMap` / `getFileRank` / `getCallerSignatures` are
wired — into `modules/reviews/run-executor.ts`, which adds the repo map and a
high-blast-radius note to the prompt. Toggled by `REPO_INTEL_ENABLED` (global)
and a per-agent `repo_intel` flag.

## Routes

- `GET /repos/:id/index-state` — index status (drives the **Indexed** badge).
- `POST /repos/:id/resync` — enqueue a re-index.
